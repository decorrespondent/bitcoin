# Bitcoin research

This repo contains some notebooks and code for bitcoin research, using the [BlockSci parser](https://github.com/citp/BlockSci), developed by CITP of Princeton University. You need an Amazon EC2 instance of BlockSci to run this code. Also you need some basic knowledge on the structure of bitcoin transactions.

This code is used for research by De Correspondent into the funding of right wing (alt-right, far right, extremist) activists, but the code should be re-usable for other kinds of investigations.

There are still many things to do. These are the most important and obvious steps:
1. Create a seed list of bitcoin addresses of people and organizations of interest.
2. Cluster all donations made into their bitcoin addresses (outputs).
3. Produce statistics based on these clusters.
4. Find the big donors and get all their other donations. Make a short list of people or organizations of interest.
5. Use OSINT techniques to de-anonymize the donors. 
6. Profit

If you are interested in helping out with any of these steps, please drop me a line.

The code was partly written by Hidde and Alexis of ADC, [Amsterdam Data Collective.](https://amsterdamdatacollective.com/)
